Join me for this cosmic celebration where the veil between worlds feels just a little thinner.\n\n## About the Festival\n\nThe UFO Festival began 25 years ago to commemorate the famous 1950 Trent sighting, when a local McMinnville couple spotted a flying disc over their farm and made national news. Now in its quarter-century milestone year, this event has become one of the most beloved gatherings for both skeptics and believers alike.\n\nThis year's festival features renowned UAP experts, an alien parade, street fair, live music, costume contests, and much more. The entire downtown transforms into a celebration of cosmic curiosity and extraterrestrial wonder!\n\n## Tarot Readings with Crystal Seed Tarot\n\nI'll be offering intuitive tarot readings throughout both days of the festival:\n- **Friday, May 16th**: 3:00 PM - 8:00 PM\n- **Saturday, May 17th**: 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM\n\nMy readings at this special event blend cosmic awareness with practical guidance, perfect for those seeking answers about their path forward or connections to something beyond our ordinary understanding. Whether you're a festival regular or a curious first-timer, a tarot reading can provide unexpected insights during this unique weekend of cosmic exploration.\n\n## Booking Information\n\nReadings will be available on a first-come, first-served basis during the festival. If you'd like to reserve a specific time slot in advance, please contact me at crystalseedtarot@gmail.com with \"UFO Festival Reading\" in the subject line.\n\nLook for my booth among the vendors along 3rd Street in downtown McMinnville.

      description: "It's finally here! My very first online Tarot course presented through Kumara Academy!!! I have been wanting to get the opportunity to do online courses for years, so this is a long time coming and I am very excited!\n\n## Course Details\n\nThis online beginner's Tarot course will be 4 weeks long with classes occurring every Sunday in February from 4:00 – 6:00 pm. No matter what level you are at with Tarot, this course will help you understand the full meanings of the cards, and how to work with them all together in a spread.\n\n## What's Included\n\nThere will be lots of hands on practice through the magic of breakout rooms, class material you get to keep and refer to whenever you'd like, and each class will be recorded and posted so you can watch them later in case you aren't able to make a class.\n\n## Future Classes\n\nThe best part is: this will be one of a series of three Tarot classes I'll be doing through Kumara this year! So the intermediate and advanced courses will be coming later in the year! If you start your Tarot journey with me now, you'll be able to proceed with the rest of the courses later in the year!\n\n## Registration\n\nClasses start on 02/02/25.

      description: "Join me for the first ever VIRTUAL  \nOregon Ghost Conference!\n\nIt's March which means it's time for my favorite event of the year: The Oregon Ghost Conference! The OGC is the biggest annual paranormal event in the state, going on since 2011. Although the event had to be cancelled last year due to Covid, this year they have decided to move the event online and do a VIRTUAL Oregon Ghost Conference and I could not be more excited! **(See information below for booking a reading with me)**\n\n## About the Oregon Ghost Conference\n\nIf you've never been to the OGC, it's a 3 day long round-the-clock event which takes place at the Seaside Convention Center. There is always an amazing array of guest speakers who give presentations on everything from paranormal experiences, to spirit communication, haunted history, and pretty much anything you could imagine in the realm of the paranormal and metaphysical. The entire convention center is PACKED with paranormal teams, psychics, readers, artists, pop-up shops selling creepy-jewelry, dowsing rods, crystals, oils, and anything one might need in their witchcraft pantry. Each day is also filled with break-out classes taking place in the spacious classrooms outlining the entire convention center. Here, you can take any class from How to Read Tarot Cards to Practicums on the best tools and tech gadgets to use for ghost hunting. There are usually a couple of bigger events in the evenings also for which you can purchase tickets; gallery readings with psychic mediums and real actual ghost hunts at the most haunted locations in town!\n\n## This Year's Virtual Format\n\nGranted, this year will be different. We won't be able to ghost hunt in person together, or casually stroll through the rows of eclectic vendors, but we can still have a Ghost Conference….of sorts! Rocky and his team are putting together an entire week of virtual events with many of participants of the OGC from years past, including yours truly. You can find an official line up of virtual events, including guest speakers, private readings, and even virtual classes at the link below.\n\n## Book a Reading with Me\n\n**I will be doing $30 30-minute readings during this year's first ever virtual Oregon Ghost Conference, this year titled \"Ghost Week\", in the evenings from 3/21/21 – 3/25/21, and all day on 3/26/21 – 3/28/21. If you'd like to book a reading with me, you can contact me at: crystalseedtarot@gmail.com**",
